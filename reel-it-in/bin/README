To successfully build the godot plugin follow these steps:


Build to test on iOS
1. cd GodotPlugin
2. ./build.sh ios debug
3. move GodotPlugin.framework and SwiftGodot.framework to the bin folder in reel-it-in/
4. Export the project as a xcode project
5. Ask Keshev or Ned about how to authenticate with apple (its very tedious)

**Note** : If You open GodotPlugin.swift in vsCode is will not recognize SwiftGodot and rge build will fail.

For Finished App w/ iOS or macOS
1. Replace all 'debug' commands with 'release'
2. Same process as above
