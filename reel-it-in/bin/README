# Godot Plugin Build Instructions

This document explains how to build the Godot plugin for iOS, handle common issues, and prepare your project for testing with Firebase.

---

## Build on iOS

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the plugin folder:
   cd GodotPlugin

2. Build the iOS debug libraries:
   ./build.sh ios debug
   - The build should start with:
     "Building iOS libraries (debug)..."
   - And finish with:
     "Finished building debug libraries for ios platforms"

3. Copy the frameworks to your project:
   - Move GodotPlugin.framework and SwiftGodot.framework from GodotPlugin to:
     reel-it-in/bin/ios
     (this is the active build used by your game)

4. Export your Godot project as an Xcode project.

5. In Godot Export Settings:
   - Go to Capabilities → enable Access WiFi
     (required for Firebase authentication)

6. Export non-resource files:
   - Go to Project → Export → iOS → Resources → Filters to export non-resource files
   - Add:
     addons/godot-firebase/.env

> Note: If you open GodotPlugin.swift in VSCode, it may not recognize SwiftGodot and the build could fail. Always build via the terminal script.

## Hard Reset (if the build is acting strange)

Sometimes cached build artifacts can cause issues. To reset:

1. Navigate to the plugin folder:
   cd GodotPlugin

2. Delete the build folder:
   rm -rf .build

3. Clear Xcode derived data:
   sudo rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

4. Rebuild debug libraries:
   ./build.sh ios debug

---

## Testing the Finished App on iOS or macOS

1. Replace debug with release in the build command:
   ./build.sh ios release

2. Follow the same steps as above for exporting and running.
