# Building the Godot Plugin

## Build to test on iOS
1. cd GodotPlugin
2. Run ```./build.sh ios debug``` (should start with "Building iOS libraries (debug)..." and finish with "Finished building debug libraries for ios platforms")
3. move GodotPlugin.framework and SwiftGodot.framework from GodotPlugin to reel-it-in/bin/ios (this is the active build)
4. Export the project as a xcode project
5. Ask Keshav or Ned about how to authenticate with Apple (it's very tedious)

### **Note** : If you open GodotPlugin.swift in VSCode, it will not recognize SwiftGodot and the build will fail.

## If the build is acting strange... 

It is worth hard reseting by deleting the .build in GodotPlugin and rerunning the commands.

1. cd GodotPlugin
2. rm -rf .build
3. sudo rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
4. ./build.sh ios debug

## For testing the finished app on iOS or macOS
1. Replace all 'debug' commands with 'release'
2. Follow the process as above
